# STARSHIP MADE OF LIES — Skill Tree

*Last Updated: 2026-05-11 (PHASE 17.J 10/11 sub-tasks shipped)*
*Project: SMoL (Starship Made of Lies) — formerly Unity Missile System*
*Unity AI Lab*

> ## ⚠ REALITY CHECK 2026-05-11
>
> **The per-row `⬜ planned` markers in the SMoL Capability Map (sections 1–15 below) capture DESIGN INTENT — what each skill SHOULD do when fully implemented.** Many are SHIPPED today; some are partially wired; some remain pure design.
>
> **For the honest shipped-state snapshot of SMoL**, see the new **🎯 SMoL Implementation Snapshot (2026-05-11)** section immediately below. It reflects post-PHASE 17.A/B/I + super-review × 2 (30+ code-review fixes) + 10/11 PHASE 17.J sub-tasks shipped (panel framework + TopToolbar + Reset Layout + Planet Energy panel + Battery Bank + 3-tier reactor buildings + reactor fuel loading + Citizens panel with ship-duty sliders + modular 8-slot ship builder + saved blueprints library). Only 17.J.10 (per-launch crew/cargo UI + blueprint→launch wiring) remains open.
>
> **For the UMS LEGACY summary at the bottom of this doc** (`Feature Status Summary` showing 101/101 complete + `Future Possibilities`) — that table describes the Unity Missile System Space Engineers project's complete shipped state. It's preserved as canonical math reference until PHASE 15 nuke. SMoL is the active project on top.

## 📚 SMoL Capability Map (Design Intent — what each skill SHOULD do)

> The tables below are the canonical _design specification_ for every SMoL capability across 15 domains × 4 complexity tiers × 4 priority levels. Skills marked `⬜ planned` describe the FULL intended behavior — even when partially shipped, this captures what "done" looks like.

---

## SMoL — CURRENT PROJECT SKILL TREE (Templated Scaffold)

> Capability map for SMoL — the top-down emoji civilization-builder. Organized by DOMAIN (15 areas), COMPLEXITY (Basic / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert), and PRIORITY (P0 Critical / P1 Important / P2 Nice / P3 Future). This is a SCAFFOLD — capabilities get marked as PHASES 1-14 complete and the corresponding skill nodes light up.

### By Complexity (rolled up across domains)

| Tier | Description | Domains touched |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Basic** | Foundational primitives (anonymous play, basic SFX, T-shirt UX) | All domains |
| **Intermediate** | Standard operational capabilities (theme system mechanics, AI personality, per-base panels) | All domains |
| **Advanced** | Power-user features (theme-gated diplomacy, server fog-of-war, multi-pad coordination, great-circle math) | 4-12 |
| **Expert** | System integration mastery (multi-level LOD, theme catalog 15+, intercept math, 1000-planet 60fps) | 2, 7, 8, 9 |

### By Priority (rolled up)

- **P0 Critical** — Required for SMoL to function as the designed game (galaxy gen, missile system, theme system foundations, multiplayer server, basic platform packaging)
- **P1 Important** — Significantly improves quality (per-theme assets, achievements, mobile UX, intercept math, conquest tech-loot)
- **P2 Nice-to-Have** — Polish (cinematic camera moments, spatial audio, theme conversion on conquered planets, app store submission)
- **P3 Future** — Post-MVP (modding, localization, spectator mode, ranked seasonal ladder, cross-progression)

## 🏛️ LEGACY: Unity Missile System (UMS) — Final Shipped State

> The table below is the **complete shipped state of the LEGACY Unity Missile System (UMS) project** — the Space Engineers Programmable Block project that this repository was originally before pivoting to SMoL on 2026-05-09. **It is preserved as canonical math reference for SMoL's colony-ship trajectory math** (see `_ums-reference/`). The 101/101 figure refers to the UMS C# scripts' final state, NOT to SMoL features.
>
> **For SMoL's actual shipped state, scroll to the top: 🎯 SMoL Implementation Snapshot.**

### UMS Feature Status Summary (legacy — 101 features in 11 categories)

| Category | Total | Complete | Pending |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| Boot & System Init | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Guidance & Navigation | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Communication | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Display & UI | 10 | 10 | 0 |
| Block Detection | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Signal Controller | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| Inventory | 16 | 16 | 0 |
| Construction | 8 | 8 | 0 |
| Launch Operations | 9 | 9 | 0 |
| Mass Operations | 9 | 9 | 0 |
| Safety Systems | 9 | 9 | 0 |
| **UMS TOTAL** | **101** | **101** | **0** |

These 101 features port 1:1 into SMoL's TypeScript implementation (trajectory math, pad state machine, salvo stagger, telemetry channels). Port progress lives in the SMoL Implementation Snapshot above. UMS source deletion is gated on full SMoL completion + post-playtest verification (PHASE 15).

### UMS Future Possibilities (carried forward into SMoL as design seeds)

Things UMS didn't implement that became SMoL ship-variant or tech-tree design intent:

- Spiral approach patterns for evasion → **SMoL ship variant: 'spiral' guidance mode**
- Terminal guidance correction → **SMoL Tier 2 tech: 'Terminal Guidance Correction'**
- Multi-target sequencing → **SMoL salvo controller mode (auto-fire round)**
- Decoy deployment → **SMoL Decoy colony-ship variant (Tier 2)**
- EMP payload mode → **SMoL Saboteur ship payload type (Tier 3)**
- Formation flying → **SMoL counter-colony-ship intercept geometry**
- Return-to-base abort → **SMoL ABORT command on all flights**
- Damage assessment telemetry → **SMoL FlightDetailPanel post-impact log**
- Fuel efficiency optimization → **SMoL fuel-remaining → AoE damage scaling**
- Adaptive guidance switching → **SMoL 6 targeting modes with mode-specific dispersion**
